# Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive data analysis process, starting with fetching data from Kaggle. The data is then cleaned, preprocessed, and enhanced through feature engineering and feature selection. Afterward, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to identify key trends and insights. A Streamlit application is built to visualize the findings, and the app is deployed on Render for easy access and interaction.
